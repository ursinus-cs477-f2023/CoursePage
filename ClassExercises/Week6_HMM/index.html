									<h2>Markov Chains As Bayesian Networks</h2>

									<p>
										We've already seen <a href = "../Week4_Markov/">Markov chains</a>, where the probability of transitioning from one state to the next is completely independent of the previous states.  This is known as the <b>Markov state assumption</b>.  If we let the variable <code>X<sub>i</sub></code> represent the state that we're in at step <code>i</code>, then we can depict this as the following state diagram: 
									</p>

									<img src = "MarkovStateDiagram.svg" width=500>

									<p>
										This is a specific instance of a more general state diagram known as a "<a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-networks-81031eeed94e">Bayesian Network</a>."  The arrows indicate conditional dependencies.  What this diagram is saying specifically is that the "joint probability" (AND) of all states in a Markov sequence can be written as follows:
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = p(x_1) \times p(x_2 | x_1) \times p(x_3 | x_2) \times ... \times p(x_n | x_{n-1})\]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Notice how we only condition on the states that are at the tail of arrows, which represents the Markov assumption graphically.
									</p>

									<h2><a name = "hmss">Hidden Markov Models</a></h2>
									<p>
										Markov models are applicable to time sequence data that we can observe directly, like the text strings in <a href = "../../Assignments/HW3_Markov/">assignment 3</a>.  However, there are plenty of time sequence scenarios where we can't observe what we actually want to know directly.  For example, in a <a href = "https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/ece417/fa2017/rabiner89.pdf">speech to text system</a>, we observe noisy audio data over time, but we actually want to know the text string that someone is saying.

										We can model problems with a hidden state and an observation using a <b>Hidden Markov Model (HMM)</b>.  Now, in addition to our sequence <b>x<SUB>1</SUB>, x<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., x<SUB>n</SUB></b>, which is what we want to know, we also have a sequence <b>y<SUB>1</SUB>, y<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., y<SUB>n</SUB></b>, in which we observe something at each state.  The Bayes net for a hidden markov model looks like this:
									</p>

									<img src = "HiddenMarkovStateDiagram.svg" width=600>
									
									<p>
										In addition to the Markov state assumption, we also have the <b>Markov observation assumption</b>; that is, each observation <b>y<SUB>i</SUB></b> only depends on the state <b>x<SUB>i</SUB></b> and is independent of all other states and all other observations.
									</p>

									<h2><a name = "bayesfilter">Bayes Filtering</a></h2>
									

									<p>
										Now that we have the HMM framework, let's start trying to do some inference on it given some measurements over time.  The first problem we'll solve is known as <b>filtering</b>, and its goal is to estimate over time a probability distribution over all of the hidden states.  As more measurements come in, we update the distribution.  We can estimate where we think we are as the state which has the maximum probability given the measurements up to a particular point in time.  Because we update as things are streaming in, this is referred to as an <b>online method</b>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Before we dive into a formal specification of this process, let's sketch out an example for intuition.  Let's suppose we have a robot on a grid as in <a href = "../../Assignments/HW4_RobotLocalization/">assignment 4</a> that can move left/right/up/down or stay still at any time.  Let's also suppose that we know with perfect certainty that it starts at the center of a square map.  Below is how we would forecast the probability of being in future positions on that map if we knew nothing else, assuming that we're equally likely to stay still or move left/right/up/down:
									</p>

									<img src = "BayesMarkovOnly.gif">



									<p>
										Since we're equally likely to stay still or move left/right/up/down, we have to hedge our bets in all directions at each step.  The result is that the once very certain probability "smears out" and distributes in all directions.  This is pure Markov, and is referred to as the <b>state transition step</b> for the hidden states.  However, we have also have measurements at each timestep that help us to narrow down the possible states.  Let's suppose we receive noisy measurements that indicate that the robot is moving to the right.  Then we can do a two step process at each timestep where we diffuse the probability in the state transitions, but then we update our forecast based on measurement.  Here's how that might look in this example:
									</p>

									<img src = "BayesFullFilter.gif">

									<p>
										Notice how the probability density still diffuses at each transition, but the measurement helps it to sharpen around the true location.  This is the power of Bayes filtering in the HMM framework: it takes into consideration both <b>transitions</b> of the hidden states, as well as <b>measurement probabilities</b> to help narrow down the states.
									</p>

									<p>
										Now let's put on some formal notation and define exactly what it is we're looking for.  Given the first <b>n</b> measurements, we want to figure out the probability that the hidden state <b>x<SUB>n</SUB></b> is a particular state <b>k</b> at time <b>n</b>.  
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ f_n(k) =  p(x_n = k | y_1, y_2, ..., y_n) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Let's consider what happens when we apply Bayes' rule within the space of intersection of all measurements that have happened before this step only: <b>y<SUB>1</SUB>, y<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., y<SUB>n-1</SUB></b>.  By Bayes' rule, we can rewrite our expression as 
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ f_n(k) = p(\boldsymbol{x_n = k | y_n}, y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n-1}) = \frac{p(\boldsymbol{y_n | x_n = k}, y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n-1}) p(\boldsymbol{x_n = k |} y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n-1})}{p(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)} \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										By the <b>Markov measurement assumption</b>, measurement <b>y<SUB>n</SUB></b> only depends on state <b>x<SUB>n</SUB></b> and is independent of all other measurements, so we can simplify this to 
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ f_n(k) = \frac{p(y_n | x_n = k) p(x_n = k | y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n-1})}{p(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)} \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Now we have to tackle the second term in the numerator, <b>p(x<SUB>n</SUB> | y<SUB>1</SUB>, y<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., y<SUB>n-1</SUB>)</b>.  Actually, if we had solved something similar at the last measurement and kept track of it:
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ f_{n-1}(j) = p(x_{n-1} = j | y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n-1}) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										then we can make some headway here by coming up with an expression in terms of this.  The key insight is that in the absence of a new measurement, <b>p(x<SUB>n</SUB> | y<SUB>1</SUB>, y<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., y<SUB>n-1</SUB>)</b> is simply like transitioning from <b>x<SUB>n-1</SUB></b> to <b>x<SUB>n</SUB></b> by following an ordinary Markov state transition, since, by the <b>Markov state property</b>, the state <b>x<SUB>n</SUB></b> only depends on <b>x<SUB>n-1</SUB></b>.  So we'll consider what happens of we transitioned from every possible state at <b>x<SUB>n-1</SUB></b> to <b>x<SUB>n</SUB></b>.  The picture below shows this
									</p>

									<img src = "jtok.svg" width=200>
									<p></p>
									<p>
										Since all of the possible <b>j</b> values at state <b>x<SUB>n-1</SUB></b> are disjoint, we can sum up the probabilities over all <b>j</b>.  Let's suppose we have <b>K</b> unique states.  Then the expression is as follows
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ p(x_n = k | y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n-1}) = \sum_{j=1}^K  f_{n-1}(j) p(x_n = k | x_{n-1} = j)\]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Plugging this back into our original expression, we have
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ f_n(k) = \frac{p(y_n | x_n = k) \left( \sum_{j=1}^K  f_{n-1}(j) p(x_n = k | x_{n-1} = j) \right)}{p(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)}  \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										This is very neat, because now we almost have a recursive expression for <b>f<SUB>n</SUB></b> in terms of <b>f<SUB>n-1</SUB></b>.  The only thing that remains is the denominator.  Actually, because <b>x<SUB>n</SUB> = k</b> is disjoint over all <b>k</b>, we can write the denominator as the sum of all possible numerators.
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ f_n(k) = \frac{p(y_n | x_n = k) \left( \sum_{j=1}^K  f_{n-1}(j) p(x_n = k | x_{n-1} = j) \right)}{\sum_{k = 1}^K p(y_n | x_n = k) \left( \sum_{j=1}^K  f_{n-1}(j) p(x_n = k | x_{n-1} = j) \right)}  \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										This is analogous to how we <a href = "https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/12848/quizzes/16209">computed the overall probability of testing positive for covid</a> as 
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ p(\text{positive}) = p(\text{positive} | \text{covid}) + p(\text{positive} | \text{not covid}) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										So now, we have a complete expression for <b>f<SUB>n</SUB></b> in terms of known <b>measurement probabilities</b> <b>p(y<SUB>n</SUB> | x<SUB>n</SUB>)</b> and <b>transition probabilities</b> <b>p(x<SUB>n</SUB> = k | x<SUB>n-1</SUB> = j)</b>, which we assume we know.  This means we can continue to update a single array of probabilities over all states as we get a new measurement.  The complexity of such an update is <b>O(K)</b> space and time, since there are <b>K</b> states.  The pseudocode below summarizes the algorithm

									<h4><a name = "bayesfiltercomplexity">A Note on Complexity</a></h4>
									<p>
										Over all timesteps, the above algorithm uses <b>O(K)</b> memory to store <b>f</b> and the intermediate <b>g</b> array.  On the other hand, it takes <b>O(KT<SUP>2</SUP>)</b> computation time in the worst case.  This is due to the triply nested for loop; for each timestep (of which there are <b>T</b>) for each state (of which there are <b>K</b>), we have to look back at <b>K</b> states at the previous timestep.  However, if we can limit the previous states we have to look at to a small constant, then this turns into <b>O(KT)</b> complexity.  For instance, in the <a href = "../../Assignments/HW4_RobotLocalization/index.html#filtering">robot localization</a> problem, we only have to consider the states that neighbor on the map and the state itself, which is at most 5.

									<h2><a name = "viterbi">The Viterbi Algorithm: Maximizing Joint Posterior Likelihood</a></h2>
									<p>
										<b>NOTE: </b> In the discussion below, <b>argmax<SUB>j</SUB>(arr)</b> means to find the index <b>j</b> in the array <b>arr</b> that maximizes <b>arr[j]</b>.  For instance, if we were 0-indexing an array, <b>argmax<SUB>j</SUB> [5, 8, -4, 3]</b> would be 1
									</p>

									<p>
										We can also use the <a href = "../Week5_BagOfWords/#theory">Bayesian classification framework</a> to figure out the <b>joint likelihood over all of the hidden states given the observations</b> given the observations.  This will help us to avoid making mistakes in individual steps since all of the steps have to be coherent across the entire sequence.  This is the reason that speech to text works really well even when peoples' speech is noisy and garbled.  Since we have to have the entire sequence of measurements ahead of time, though, this is referred to as an <b>offline method</b>.
										
										
									</p>
									
									<p>
									Let's begin to get at the math by looking at the <b>posterior likelihood</b> of the hidden states given all observations
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ \ell(x_1, x_2, ... x_n | y_1, y_2, ..., y_n) = p(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n | x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Because we still have the Markov state assumption, the second term of the joint probability of the state sequence can be written as 
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = p(x_1) \times p(x_2 | x_1) \times p(x_3 | x_2) \times ... \times p(x_n | x_{n-1})\]
									</h3>

									<p>
										just as before.  But now we have another multiplicative term of the observations given the states.  Because of the Markov observation assumption, we can write this second probability as
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ p(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n) = p(y_1 | x_1) \times p(y_2 | x_2) \times ... \times ... \times p(y_n | x_n)\]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Putting this all together, we get the following expression for the posterior likelihood, which includes all of the same probabilities, as well as the probabilities for observations
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ \ell(x_1, x_2, ... x_n | y_1, y_2, ..., y_n) = \left( p(x_1) \times p(x_2 | x_1) \times p(x_3 | x_2) \times ... \times p(x_n | x_{n-1}) \right) \left( p(y_1 | x_1) \times p(y_2 | x_2) \times ... \times ... \times p(y_n | x_n) \right) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										We can also write this in log form as a sum.  This important, <i>the probability of an individual sequence will be very small, and we want to avoid numerical underflow</i>.  Abbreviating the full state sequences as <b>x<SUB>1:n</SUB></b> and the full observation sequence as <b>y<SUB>1:n</SUB></b>, we have
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ \log \ell(x_{1:n} | y_{1:n}) = \log(p(x_1)) + \sum_{i = 2}^n \log(p(x_i | x_{i-1})) + \sum_{i=1}^n \log(p(y_i | x_i)) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Finding the most likely sequence of hidden states is akin to finding the <b>x<SUB>1:n</SUB></b> that maximizes the above expression.  This is also referred to as the <b>maximum a posteriori estimate</b>.  Formally, it is written as 
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ \text{argmax}_{x_{1:n}} \log \ell(x_{1:n} | y_{1:n}) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										If we had a brute force approach to solving this, how many combinations of states would we have to check?  Let's suppose that we had <b>K</b> states and <b>T</b> timesteps.  Then, unfortunately, we'd have to check <b>K<SUP>T</SUP></b> different combinations of states.  For example, suppose our state space was <b>{a, b, c}</b> and we had 4 timesteps.  Then we'd have to consider the <b>3<SUP>4</SUP> = 81</b> sequences: 
									</p>
									<p>
										['aaaa', 'aaab', 'aaac', 'aaba', 'aabb', 'aabc', 'aaca', 'aacb', 'aacc', 'abaa', 'abab', 'abac', 'abba', 'abbb', 'abbc', 'abca', 'abcb', 'abcc', 'acaa', 'acab', 'acac', 'acba', 'acbb', 'acbc', 'acca', 'accb', 'accc', 'baaa', 'baab', 'baac', 'baba', 'babb', 'babc', 'baca', 'bacb', 'bacc', 'bbaa', 'bbab', 'bbac', 'bbba', 'bbbb', 'bbbc', 'bbca', 'bbcb', 'bbcc', 'bcaa', 'bcab', 'bcac', 'bcba', 'bcbb', 'bcbc', 'bcca', 'bccb', 'bccc', 'caaa', 'caab', 'caac', 'caba', 'cabb', 'cabc', 'caca', 'cacb', 'cacc', 'cbaa', 'cbab', 'cbac', 'cbba', 'cbbb', 'cbbc', 'cbca', 'cbcb', 'cbcc', 'ccaa', 'ccab', 'ccac', 'ccba', 'ccbb', 'ccbc', 'ccca', 'cccb', 'cccc']
									</p>
									<p>
										This quickly grows intractable for any reasonable problem.  For instance, if we're localizing a robot on a 100x100 grid, then <b>K = 10000</b>.  Let's suppose we're measuring at 30 frames per second for 10 seconds, so <b>T = 300</b>.  Then we'd need to check <b>10000<SUP>300</SUP></b> combinations of states.  This is <i>beyond astronomical</i> in size!  So we're going to need a smarter approach.
									</p>

									<p>
										Actually, we can do something kind of similar to Bayes filtering, except we're going to need to store a bit more information.  Let's let <b>L<SUB>n, k</SUB></b> be the maximum <b>log likelihood</b> of the joint distribution over the first <b>n</b> states that end at state <b>x<sub>n</sub> = k</b>.  We can think of <b>L</b> as holding optimal cumulative probabilities of traveling up to a certain point in time.  As with Bayes filtering, we can write <b>L<SUB>n, k</SUB></b> in terms of maximum likelihoods one step prior in time, since every step before that is independent, as well as the measurement at time <b>n</b>.  In particular, we have the following recurrence:
									</p>

									<h3>
										\[ L_{n, k} = \log(p(y_n | x_n = k) + \max_{j} \left( L_{n-1, j} + \log(p(x_n = k | x_{n-1} = j)) \right) \]
									</h3>

									<p>
										Or, in other words, accumulating the next step in the joint probability adds on a term for the measurement probability <b>log(p(y<SUB>n</SUB> | x<SUB>n</SUB> = k))</b>, as well as the transition probability <b>log(p(x<SUB>n</SUB> | x<SUB>n-1</SUB> = j))</b>.  So we pay a cost for how good or bad the transition is and how well the new state matches the next measurement we got.  Such a recursive specification lends itself well to a bottom up <b><a href = "https://ursinus-cs371-s2021.github.io/Modules/Module10/Video4">dynamic programming</a> solution</b>, where we fill in the first row of <b>L</b> and then fill in each row one at a time successively.  We'll also store a matrix <b>B</b> which remembers which state <b>j</b> maximized <b>L<SUB>n, k</SUB></b>
									</p>

									<p>
										We start with the first row of <b>L</b> holding the prior probabilities and measurement probabilities only (since no measurements have happened yet).

								<h4><a name = "viterbicomplexity">A Note on Complexity</a></h4>
								<p>
									Like the <a href = "#bayesfiltercomplexity">bayes filter</a>, this algorithm takes <b>O(KT<SUP>2</SUP>)</b> computation time in the worst case, but this can be limited to <b>O(KT)</b> complexity if there are a small number of possible states that can be reached from any given state.  However, the memory requirements are worse at <b>O(KT)</b>, and there's no way around this, because we need to remember enough information to backtrace a full optimal trajectory at the end.  In practice, we could just store the <b>B</b> array and the most recently filled in row of <b>L</b>m but it's still <b>O(KT)</b> to store the entire <b>B</b> array.
								</p>
								
								
								<p></p><p></p>
								<h2>Going Further: Continuous State Spaces</h2>
								<p>
									We've covered a lot of ground through some really important algorithms here.  But these algorithms will completely fail if the state space is continuous, since there are an infinite number of possible states.  We can choose to discretize the space; for instance, if we were trying to do GPS localization, we could round every latitude and longitude to the 3rd decimal place.  But this may not be fine enough, and we will still have tons of states, grinding our computation to a halt and blowing up memory.  
								</p>
								<p>
									To deal with large or possibly infinite state space, there are two common approaches in CS.  One is to maintain a <b>continuous distribution</b> on all measurment probabilities, transition probabilties, and filtered probabilities.  If the choice of distribution is a <a href = "../Week6_GradSchoolAdmissions/">Gaussian</a>, then this leads to something known as a <a href = "https://www.kalmanfilter.net/background.html">Kalman filter</a>.  This is widely used in many localization problems (apparently my dad used to use this when working on the <a href = "https://www.kalmanfilter.net/kalman1d.html">Landsat 7 satellite</a>).  
									
								</p>
								<p>
									The problem with the Gaussian assumption, though, is that it only works for data that is "unimodal"; that is, there is only one peak in the probability distribution.  In other words, there is one state which is much more likely than all of the others given a particular sequence of measurements.  This doesn't work, for example, in our <a href = "../../Assignments/HW4_RobotLocalization/">robot localization</a> problem when the robot is in symmetric hallways, because there are many possible hypotheses.  There is an alternative known as a <b>particle filter</b> that can handle such cases by approximating a continuous distribution by a collection of discrete samples.  A particle filter is an instance of what's known as a "genetic algorithm."  You can <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/particle-filter-a-hero-in-the-world-of-non-linearity-and-non-gaussian-6d8947f4a3dc">click here</a> to read more about it.  I wish we had time to do it in this class, because it's really cool!
